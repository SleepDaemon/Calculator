"# Calculator" 

NOTICE: Majority of the code is copied from https://github.com/michalosman/calculator, as I had a similar code written out except more messy and filled with bugs.
The only difference is I have edited the CSS so it is a dark mode rather than michalosman's light mode style.

I would've tried clean up my code and fix the bugs myself but I am on tight schedule deadline I set myself, and wish not to delay any further. Also in most real world, you would usually look up solutions and copy someone else's code.

My etch-sketch code is also based off of michalosman's code as well, but there is more difference between the two to a point it is more like it was inspired.
